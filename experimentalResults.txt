	*) For each Word variable chooses first assignment that leads to non-empty neighbors' domains upon FC

2) Letter-by-Letter Search w/ Basic Magnitude/NeighborAverage Scoring
	*) Score = alpha*x + beta*y
		x = total magnitude of neighbors' domains after FC
		y = mean size of neighbors' domains after FC
