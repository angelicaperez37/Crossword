Models:
	1) Model as CSP
	2) Model as MDP

Variable Ordering Algorithms:
	1) Most Constrained Variable
		-Must assign every variable
		-If going to fail, fail early
		-Useful when at least some factors are constraints
	2) Least Constrained Variable
		-Need to choose some value
		-Choosing value most likely to lead to solution
		-Useful when all factors are constraints

Search Algorithms:
	1) Backtracking Search:
		Backtrack(x,w,Domains):
			-If x is complete assignment, update best and return
			-Choose unassigned VARIABLE X_i
			-Order VALUES in Domain_i
			-For each value v in that order:
				gamma = PROD(f_j(x U {X_i = v})) //f_j = 1 if constraint satisfied
				If gamma == 0: continue
				Domains' = Propogate(Domains)
				Backtrack(x U {X_i=v}, w*gamma,Domains')

	2) Beam Search:
		BeamSearch([x],[w],[Domains],K):
			-For each assignment x_j
				-For each var i = 1,...n:
					[x_j'] = {x U {X_i=v} for x \in C for v \in Domain_i}
			-Choose K partial assignments with highest weights and run Beam search on them

	3) Supervised Learning Using Classification and Regression
